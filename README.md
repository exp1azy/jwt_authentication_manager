# JWTAuthenticationManager

This library provides a reusable implementation of JWT-based authentication for ASP.NET Core applications. The goal is to avoid repeating boilerplate code across projects and simplify the setup of secure, token-based authentication. The library is intended for internal use or integration into microservices where consistent authentication logic is required.
